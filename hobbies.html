    <h3>Graffiti</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I love doing graffiti, because it's a street art. It’s been a hobby for
        me since I was a teenager and since I discovered the Hip-Hop culture.

    <h3>Listening to Music</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I like to listen to Hip Hop music, as I mentioned above. I feel that I
        find myself in the lyrics and in the artists’ lives.

    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I’ve liked computer games since I was a child. Being a very competitive
        person, I like games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike or Dota 2,
        but I also enjoy story games like RDR 2, GTA, Cyberpunk 2077 or FarCry.

    <h3>Watching Documentaries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am a person who loves science, new technologies (that's why I’ve
        attended an Engineering University) and history (funny, right?) and
        that's why I like to watch documentaries related to the topics listed
        above. I especially enjoy documentaries about World Wars and about the
        Nazi technologies of that time.
